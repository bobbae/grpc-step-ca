## Initialize and bootstrap step CA

https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/getting-started


```
$ step ca init
‚úî Deployment Type: Standalone
What would you like to name your new PKI?
‚úî (e.g. Smallstep): Example Inc.‚ñà
What DNS names or IP addresses would you like to add to your new CA?
‚úî (e.g. ca.smallstep.com[,1.1.1.1,etc.]): localhost
What IP and port will your new CA bind to?
‚úî (e.g. :443 or 127.0.0.1:443): 127.0.0.1:8443
What would you like to name the CA's first provisioner?
‚úî (e.g. you@smallstep.com): bob@example.com
Choose a password for your CA keys and first provisioner.
‚úî [leave empty and we'll generate one]: abc123

Generating root certificate... done!
Generating intermediate certificate... done!

‚úî Root certificate: /home/bob/.step/certs/root_ca.crt
‚úî Root private key: /home/bob/.step/secrets/root_ca_key
‚úî Root fingerprint: 36b696fb9832c4fefa934f8ad92dfebd250390bb116a3dfa56dd37b244e42351
‚úî Intermediate certificate: /home/bob/.step/certs/intermediate_ca.crt
‚úî Intermediate private key: /home/bob/.step/secrets/intermediate_ca_key
‚úî Database folder: /home/bob/.step/db
‚úî Default configuration: /home/bob/.step/config/defaults.json
‚úî Certificate Authority configuration: /home/bob/.step/config/ca.json

Your PKI is ready to go. To generate certificates for individual services see 'step help ca'.

FEEDBACK üòç üçª
  The step utility is not instrumented for usage statistics. It does not phone
  home. But your feedback is extremely valuable. Any information you can provide
  regarding how you‚Äôre using `step` helps. Please send us a sentence or two,
  good or bad at feedback@smallstep.com or join GitHub Discussions

# Run step CA

$ step-ca $(step path)/config/ca.json
badger 2022/03/18 22:13:24 INFO: All 0 tables opened in 0s
Please enter the password to decrypt /home/bob/.step/secrets/intermediate_ca_key: abc123

```

### accessing CA and bootstrap

```
$ step certificate fingerprint $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
36b696fb9832c4fefa934f8ad92dfebd250390bb116a3dfa56dd37b244e42351


$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url localhost:8443 --fingerprint 36b696fb9832c4fefa934f8ad92dfebd250390bb116a3dfa56dd37b244e42351
‚ö†Ô∏è  It looks like step is already configured to connect to an authority.
You can use 'contexts' to easily switch between teams and authorities.
Learn more at https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/the-step-command#contexts.

‚úî Would you like to overwrite /home/bob/.step/certs/root_ca.crt [y/n]: y
The root certificate has been saved in /home/bob/.step/certs/root_ca.crt.
‚úî Would you like to overwrite /home/bob/.step/config/defaults.json [y/n]: y
The authority configuration has been saved in /home/bob/.step/config/defaults.json.

```

The step command will now trust your CA.


### establish system-wide trust of your CA

So your certificates will be trusted by curl and other programs.

step certificate install $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt


### ask the CA for a certificate  and private key 

```
$ step ca certificate localhost srv.crt srv.key
‚úî Provisioner: bob@example.com (JWK) [kid: JhF08PmY4z3QWCVvtMiAIN_CJvmdMpIkpTcVQOzDJe0]
Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key: abc123
‚úî CA: https://localhost:8443
‚úî Certificate: srv.crt
‚úî Private Key: srv.key
```


### Run a test server with the certificate

go run testcert/main.go &

### Access the test server

```
$ curl https://localhost:9443/hi
Hello, world!
```

Because the root_ca.crt is installed as system-wide trust of CA already.

If this was not the case, you have to get root certificate and pass to the client.

To get the root certificate from CA the step CA should be running.

```
$ step-ca $(step path)/config/ca.json
```

```
$ step ca root root.crt
$ curl --cacert root.crt https://localhost:9443/hi
Hello, world!
```


## Run grpc and grpc-gateway example program

### Get the certificate and key for localhost

step ca certificate localhost srv.crt srv.key

### Run the server

go run server/main.go 

The grpc server is at 5443 and HTTPS server is 6443.

### Run grpc client


grpcurl -d '{"name": "bob"}' localhost:5443 helloworld.Greeter.SayHello

If root.crt is installed system-wide it should work.

If there is an issue use -cacert ca.crt.

### Run https client

curl -X POST -k https://localhost:6443/v1/example/echo -d '{"name": " hello"}'


If root.crt is installed system-wide it should work.

If there is an issue use -cacert ca.crt.


##  Basic Operations: Create and use X.509 certificates

https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations/#create-and-work-with-x509-certificates


### Create root CA

step certificate create --profile root-ca "Example Root CA" root_ca.crt root_ca.key

### Create intermediate CA signed by root CA

step certificate create "Example Intermediate CA 1"     intermediate_ca.crt intermediate_ca.key     --profile intermediate-ca --ca ./root_ca.crt --ca-key ./root_ca.key

### Create a leaf certificate bundle

step certificate create example.com example.com.crt example.com.key --profile leaf --not-after=8760h  --ca ./intermediate_ca.crt --ca-key ./intermediate_ca.key --bundle

### Verify the leaf certificate

step certificate verify example.com.crt --roots root_ca.crt

### install the certificate into the system trust store

step certificate install root_ca.crt

### inspect the leaf certificate

step certificate inspect example.com.crt --short

step certificate inspect example.com.crt --format json | jq -r .validity.end

### inspect any certificate

step certificate inspect https://smallstep.com --format json | jq -r .validity.end

### Get a TLS Certificate From Let's Encrypt using ACME via step CA

step ca certificate example.com example.com.crt example.com.key  --acme https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
